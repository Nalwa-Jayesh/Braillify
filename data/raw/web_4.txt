In addition to braille text (letters, punctuation, contractions), it is also possible to create embossed illustrations and graphs, with the lines either solid or made of series of dots, arrows, and bullets that are larger than braille dots. A full braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns, each column having three dots.[3] The dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six.[3] There are 64 possible combinations, including no dots at all for a word space.[4] Dot configurations can be used to represent a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or even a word.[3]
