Braille characters are formed using a combination of six raised dots arranged in a 3 2 matrix, called the braille cell. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguishes one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language, and even within one; in English braille there are three levels: uncontracted - a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; contracted - an addition of abbreviations and contractions used as a space-saving mechanism; and grade 3 - various non-standardized personal stenographies that are less commonly used.
