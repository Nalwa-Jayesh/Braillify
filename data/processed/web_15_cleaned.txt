OT practitioners (OTP) utilize assistive technologies (AT) to modify environments and promote access and fit to facilitate independence. For example, voice activated smart home technology allows an individual to control devices such as light switches, thermostat, oven, blinds, and music from their location. OTP evaluate client's strengths and abilities and connects with desired tasks. OTP help empower the client to match specific goals to AT tools. The theoretical approaches or frameworks OTPs frequently use to guide a client's AT choices may include: 1) The HAAT model by Cook, Polgar Encarnaçāo (2015)[11] 2) The interdependence - Human Activity Assistive Technology Model (I-HAAT) by Lee, et al. (2020);[12] 3) The SETT Framework by Zabala (2005);[13] or 4) The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT 2) by Venkatesh, Thong Xu (2012). Also, OTPs may seek advanced training through the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA)[14] organization to receive their Assistive Technology Professional (ATP) Certification and or Seating and Mobility Specialist (SMS) Certification. Additional trainings and certifications may specialize in a focus area such as the Certified Assistive Technology Instructional Specialist for Individuals with Visual Impairments (CATISTM) (ACVREP, 2024).[15]
