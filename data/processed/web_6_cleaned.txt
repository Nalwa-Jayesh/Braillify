Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments so as to be usable by disabled people.[1] The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible developments ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).[2]
